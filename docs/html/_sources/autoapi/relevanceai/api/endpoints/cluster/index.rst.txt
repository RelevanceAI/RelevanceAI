   relevanceai.api.endpoints.cluster.ClusterClient




.. py:class:: ClusterClient(project, api_key)

   Bases: :py:obj:`relevanceai.base._Base`

   Base class for all relevanceai client utilities

   .. py:method:: aggregate(self, dataset_id: str, vector_fields: list, metrics: list = [], groupby: list = [], filters: list = [], page_size: int = 20, page: int = 1, asc: bool = False, flatten: bool = True, alias: str = 'default')

      Takes an aggregation query and gets the aggregate of each cluster in a collection. This helps you interpret each cluster and what is in them.
      It can only can be used after a vector field has been clustered.


      For more information about aggregations check out services.aggregate.aggregate.

   .. py:method:: facets(self, dataset_id: str, facets_fields: list = [], page_size: int = 20, page: int = 1, asc: bool = False, date_interval: str = 'monthly')

      Takes a high level aggregation of every field and every cluster in a collection. This helps you interpret each cluster and what is in them.

      Only can be used after a vector field has been clustered.
