Search
==========

All of our search endpoints exist currently within our advanced_search
method. You can read the API documentation of our advanced_search
method here: https://api.ap-southeast-2.relevance.ai/latest/documentation#operation/SimpleSearchPost

This is important in allowing users to search through the documents
using `chunk` appropriately.
