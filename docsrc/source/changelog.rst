Changelog
=================

Here you will find a list of changes for each package update.

v0.31.0
---------

- Include more native sklearn integration. KMeans and MiniBatchKMeans now supported natively.
- Fix to `vectorize` and `sample` in Series
- Fixes to cluster aggregation for the clusterer class and cluster metrics for the clusterer class
- `groupby` and `agg` now supported
- Added warnings to `vectorize` method
- Bug Fix to list_closest_to_center to now return results
- Add `send_dataset`
- Add `clone_dataset` 
- Add references to available example datasets
- Added `vector_search`, `chunk_search` , `multistep_chunk_search`, `hybrid_search`
as part of the search endpoints

Developer changes:

- Added warnings module (boba-and-beer)
- Folder factor for datasets API (boba-and-beer)
- 2x Test speed up by introducing pytest-xdist with file distribution strategy (boba-and-beer)

Tests are now run modularly. In other words, if you want tests to run together, keep
them in the same file. If you want them to run in parallel, keep them in separate files.
